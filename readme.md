# Django Testing Examples

A compact, practical collection of **unit** and **integration** tests for Django projects — a learning + starter resource you can reuse.

---

## What’s inside

- Focused examples: models, views, forms, auth, signals
- Integration tests using Django’s test client
- Fixtures, factories, and mocking examples
- Notes on test performance and coverage

---

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py test
```

---

## Description

Practical tips included in the repo: use `SimpleTestCase` for non-DB tests, prefer `setUpTestData` for expensive fixtures, and mock external calls to keep tests fast and deterministic.

---

## Coverage & CI

Use `coverage` locally (`coverage run manage.py test`) and add a CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run tests and upload coverage reports.
